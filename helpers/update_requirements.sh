# It is possible that developer has conflicting versions of pip and pip-tools installed. (Installed pip version is too
# old for installed pip-tools or vice versa.) For avoiding such cases both tools are being updated manually before doing
# anything else with requirements. And `--upgrade-package pip-tools` in pip-compile call is still needed, because
# otherwise pip-tools may downgrade itself in output requirements file.
# Be aware, that if conflict is in the latest versions of both tools, it should be fixed manually by freezing pip-tools
# version in requirements.
