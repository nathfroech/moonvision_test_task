# Rule is too annoying to follow it strictly
# C0103 invalid-name: Used when the name doesn't match the regular expression associated to its type
#   (constant, variable, class...).

# Docstrings are not required (but advisable)
# C0111 missing-docstring: Used when a module, function, class or method has no docstring.

# If I am disabling the warning - I obviously don't want to receive any messages about it
# I0011 locally-disabled: Used when an inline option disables a message or a messages category.

# Sometimes it is more clear to have `else` branch. Just be reasonable.
# R1705 no-else-return: Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if containing a return
#   statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a
#   return statement.

# Such comments are not always refer to the commit which adds them.
# W0511 fixme: Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.
